            The World Wide Web

            <p>
                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system that enables information sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tim Berners-Lee was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design dismissed the common tree structure or needed keywords. Instead, it was inspired by Ted Nelson's hypertext models, that used hyperlinks to go to those hypertext.
            </p>
            <p>
                Berners-Lee model was supposed to support links between multiple databases on independent computers and allow access by many people at the same time. He also wanted it to handle more media than only text.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other ways. Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system was implemented successfully in the year 1990, when it was named the WorldWideWeb and an HTTP server. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was released to other research institutions in 1991, and was finally made public in 1993, where it exploded in popularity. The NCSA released the Mosaic Web, which was able to display inline images. The Navigator Browser then introduced Java and JavaScript.  Netscape, the maker of the Navigator Browser, was made public and started the dot-com bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.

            URLs
        </h2>

            <p>
                A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism retrieving it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most commonly reference web pages but are also used for file transfer, emails, database access and many other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI, which consists of five components decreasing significant left to right.
            </p>
            <p>
                A component is undefined if it has an associated delimiter and the delimiter does not appear in the URI; the scheme and path components are always defined. A component is empty if it has no characters; the scheme component is always non-empty. Authority components have subcomponents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The URI consists of the following: A non-empty scheme component, consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter. Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. Examples of popular schemes include http, https, ftp, mailto, file, data and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                An optional authority component, which consists of an optional userinfo, a host subcomponent and an optional port. The userinfo may consist of a username and an optional password. Use of the format username:password in the userinfo subcomponent is deprecated for security reasons. Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (:) found within an userinfo subcomponent unless the data after the colon is the empty string (indicating no password).
            </p>
            <p>
                The host subcomponent consists either of a registered name or an IP address. The port consists of decimal digits. There is also a path component, consisting of a sequence of path segments. A path is always defined, though it may be empty.  A path component may resemble or map exactly to a file system path but does not always imply a relation to one. If an authority component is defined, then the path component must either be empty or begin with a slash. By convention, in http and https URIs, the last part of a path is named path info and it is optional. It is composed by zero or more path segments that do not refer to an existing physical resource name (e.g. a file, an internal module program or an executable program) but to a logical part (e.g. a command or a qualifier part) that has to be passed separately to the first part of the path that identifies an executable module or program managed by a web server; this is often used to select dynamic content (a document, etc.) or to tailor it as requested (see also: CGI and PATH_INFO, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                An optional query or fragment could also be: a query consists of query strings of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well-defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attributeâ€“value pairs separated by a delimiter. A fragment contains a fragment identifier providing direction to a secondary resource, such as a section heading in an article identified by the remainder of the URI. When the primary resource is an HTML document, the fragment is often an id attribute of a specific element, and web browsers will scroll this element into view.

           Web Server
        </h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.

            Web Browser
        </h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%.
            </p>
            <p>
                A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web or from local storage and display it on a user's device.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into the browser. Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data. If the URL uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of communications security and information privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again. Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the course of browsing, cookies received from various websites are stored by the browser. Some of them contain login credentials or site preferences. However, others are used for tracking user behavior over long periods of time, so browsers typically provide a section in the menu for deleting cookies. Finer-grained management of cookies usually requires a browser extension.

            <h3>
                &lt;DOCTYPE&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                All HTML documents must start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE declaration&gt;. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;html&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;html&gt; tag represents the root of an HTML document. The &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the !DOCTYPE tag).
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;head&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;head&gt; element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the &lt;html&gt; tag and the &lt;body&gt; tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;meta&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;meta&gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data about data. &lt;meta&gt; tags go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services. There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the meta tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;link&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;link&gt; tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The &lt;link&gt; tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website. The &lt;link&gt; element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;title&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The &lt;title&gt; tag is required in HTML documents. The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The title element:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
                <li>provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
                <li>displays a title for the page in search-engine results</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;body&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;body&gt; tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently of the rest of the site. Potential sources for the &lt;article&gt; element:

                The &lt;p&gt; tag defines a paragraph. Browsers automatically add a single blank line before and after each &lt;p&gt; element.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can't be sure how it will be displayed. Adding space doesn't do the same in the web page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;hr&gt; tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page, and is most often displayed as a horizontal rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;hr&gt; element is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page:
            </p>
            <p>
                The HTML &lt;br&gt; element defines a line break.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use &lt;br&gt; if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
            </p>
            <p>
                The element &lt;pre&gt; defines preformatted text. The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;div&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The &lt;div&gt; tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The &lt;div&gt; tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;span&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The &lt;span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The &lt;span> tag is much like the &lt;div> element, but &lt;div> is a block-level element and &lt;span> is an inline element.
            </p>
            <h3>
                &lt;a&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the &lt;a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
                <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
                <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>
                Basics
            </h3>
            <p>
                HTML documents start with the doctype declaration. The document starts with &lt;html&gt; and ends with &lt;/html&gt;. The visible part of HTML is in the body declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
                DOCTYPE represents document type and helps the browser display web pages. It's not case-sensitive and must appear only once at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Headings are defined by the &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; tags. They decrease in significance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paragraphs are defined with &lt;p&gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag: the destination is defined by "href". Attributes are there to provide additional information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag. It contains the source (src), alternative text (alt) (needed when image cannot be loaded), and the width and height.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML can be viewed by inspecting a website.

            </h3>
            <p>
                An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. Elements can be nested, but the end tag is often needed, otherwise it may display incorrectly. They can be empty, and aren't case-sensitive ( &lt;p&gt; == &lt;P&gt;).
            </p>
            <h3>
                Attributes
            </h3>
            <p>
                All elements can have attributes. They provide additional information about elements, are specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs (name=""). Examples of attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>href in &lt;a&gt;: URL of the page the link goes to</li>
                <li>src in &lt;img&gt;: path to the image</li>
                <li>width and height in &lt;img&gt;: provide info about size</li>
                <li>alt in &lt;img&gt;: displays text when image cant be loaded</li>
                <li>style: colors, font, size and more</li>
                <li>lang in &lt;html&gt;: declares the language of the page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                HTML comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your HTML source code.

                HTML links are hyperlinks. Clicking on a link jumps to another document. The HTML &lt;a&gt; defines a hyperlink. The most important part of the element is the href attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link. This can be done by using &lt;target&gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attributes of &lt;target&gt;;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>_self: Opens document on the same page it was clicked</li>
                <li>_blank: Opens document in a new window/tab</li>
                <li>_parent: Opens document in parent frame</li>
                <li>_top: Opens document in the full body of the window</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute. A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part).
            </p>
            <p>
                To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

                Images can help the visuals of a web page. It has the following syntax:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;img&gt;: embed an image. Not inserted, just links. The tag creates the holding space. It has 2 needed attributes (src, alt).</li>
                <li>src: when a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, the image should actually stay in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise the image will not load. This is when the alt text is shown.</li>
                <li>alt: provides an alternate text when an image can't be loaded. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are also unneeded (but useful) attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>width and height: set the size of the image when it is displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When an image is in another folder it is needed to be specified in the src.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some websites point to an image on another server. To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:
            </p>
            <p>
                By putting the &lt;img&gt; tag in an &lt;a&gt; tag you can use an link as the image.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use float.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;head&gt; contains metadata (information about information) and usually describes document title, character set, styles, scripts and other meta info.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;title&gt; is text-only and is shown in the title-bar. It's required in HTML, and it is important for search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;style&gt; is for style info.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;link&gt; defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. Most used to link to external style sheets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;meta&gt; element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;script&gt; is used for client-side JavaScripts.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;base&gt; specifies the base URLs and all relative URLs in a page. Must have a href and/or target attribute present. There can only be 1 base tag.
            </p>

                CSS
            </h3>
            <p>
                Syntax:
            </p>
            <p>
                Selectors point to the element to style. The declaration block contains one or more declarations (seperated by a ";"). Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon. Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
            </p>
            <p>
                Selectors:
            </p>
            <p>
                Used to find or select elements to style. Can be divided into:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple selectors (based on name, id, class)</li>
                <li>Combinator selectors (based on specific relationship</li>
                <li>Pseudo-class selectors (based on certain state)</li>
                <li>Pseudo-element selectors (select and style a part)</li>
                <li>Attribute selectors (based on attribute and attribute values)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The element selectors select based on name.
            </p>
            <p>
                The id selectors select based on id attribute. IDs are unique so it is used to select an unique element.
            </p>
            <p>
                The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                The universal selector selects all elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The grouping selector selects all elements with the same style.
            </p>
            <p>
                Color:
            </p>
            <p>
                Can be selected with names or values (for example rbg of hex code). You can edit the color of text, background and borders.
            </p>
            <p>
                Backgrounds:
            </p>
            <p>
                You can color the background of specific elements. You can also change the opacity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Text:
            </p>
            <p>
                Css has a lot of things that can be changed in text, for example the color of the text itself or the background color of the text.
