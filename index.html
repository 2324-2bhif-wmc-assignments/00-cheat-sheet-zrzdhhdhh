            <h2 id="http">
                HTTP
            </h2>
            <p>
                HTTP is a protocol of the application layer, specifically on the 7th layer in the ISO/OSI model. It is stateless, but session data can be stored using cookies. HTTP is not limited to exchanging hypertext but can also transfer various data types. It relies on a reliable transport protocol, typically TCP (until HTTP/2) or QUIC (HTTP/3, based on UDP). Common versions include HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, with newer web browsers supporting HTTP/2.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTTP communication involves two types of messages: requests from the client to the server and responses from the server to the client. Each message consists of two parts, the message header (HTTP header) containing information about the message body, such as encoding and content type, and the message body containing the actual data.
            </p>
            <p>
                When a web browser activates a link to the URL http: //www.example.net/infotext.html, it sends a request to the computer with the hostname www.example.net to retrieve the resource /infotext.html. The hostname www.example.net is first translated into an IP address using the DNS protocol. The HTTP-GET request is sent over TCP to the HTTP server's standard port 80.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the link contains characters not allowed in the request, they are URL-encoded. Additional information, such as browser details and desired language, can be transmitted through the header in any HTTP communication. The "Host" field distinguishes different DNS names under the same IP address. It is optional under HTTP/1.0 but required under HTTP/1.1. Once the header is terminated with a blank line (or two consecutive line endings), the computer running a web server on port 80 sends an HTTP response. This response includes server header information, a blank line, and the actual content of the message, which is the content of the infotext.html file. Files are typically transmitted in page description languages like (X)HTML along with their components like images, stylesheets (CSS), scripts (JavaScript), etc., often combined by a browser for display. In principle, any file in any format can be transmitted, including dynamically generated content (e.g., CGI, SSI, JSP, PHP, or ASP.NET). Each header line is terminated by a line break &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. The blank line after the header consists only of &gt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;, without any enclosed spaces.
            </p>
            <pre>
                Response:

                HTTP/1.1 200 OK
                Server: Apache/1.3.29 (Unix) PHP/4.3.4
                Content-Length: 123456 (Size of infotext.html in bytes)
                Content-Language: de (per RFC 3282 and RFC 1766)
                Connection: close
                Content-Type: text/html
            </pre>
            <p>
                The server sends an error message and an error code if the information cannot be sent for any reason. However, status codes are also used for successful requests, typically with a response of 200 OK. The exact process of this exchange (request and response) is defined in the HTTP specification.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every HTTP request receives a response from the server with an HTTP status code. This code provides information on whether the request was successfully processed, or in case of an error, it guides the client, such as a browser, on where (e.g., redirection) or how (e.g., with authentication) to obtain the desired information if possible.
            </p>
            <pre>
                1xx – Informational
                The request is still being processed, despite the initial response. This intermediate response can be necessary because many clients automatically assume a transmission or processing error after a certain period (timeout) and abort with an error message.
                2xx – Successful Operation
                The request has been processed, and the response is sent back to the requester.
                3xx – Redirection
                To ensure successful processing of the request, further actions are required by the client. This occurs, for example, when a website has been redesigned by the operator, causing a requested file to be located elsewhere. The server response, including a Location header, informs the client of the new file location.
                4xx – Client Errors
                An error occurred in processing the request, and it is within the client's responsibility. For example, a 404 error occurs when a document is requested that does not exist on the server. A 403 error informs the client that it is not permitted to access the respective document, which could be confidential or only accessible via HTTPS.
                5xx – Server Errors
                An error has occurred, and the cause of the error is attributed to the server. For instance, a 501 error indicates that the server lacks the necessary functions (e.g., programs or other files) to process the request.
            </pre>
            <p>Requests and Responses:</p>
            <pre>
                HTTP Requests:

                Request Method: Specifies the action to be performed, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
                Request URL: The URL or URI that the client is requesting.
                Headers: These contain additional information about the request, including:
                User-Agent: Information about the client application making the request.
                Accept: The data formats (MIME types) that the client can accept. (language)
                Authorization: Credentials for authentication.
                Cookies: Data sent to the server for maintaining session state.
                Custom headers: Can include any additional information needed for the request.
                Body: For methods like POST and PUT, the body can contain data to be sent to the server. It can be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or form data.
                Status Code.

                HTTP Responses:

                Status Line: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and a brief status message.
                Headers: Similar to request headers, response headers contain additional information about the response, including:
                Server: Information about the server software.
                Content-Type: The MIME type of the response data.
                Content-Length: The size of the response body in bytes.
                Set-Cookie: Instructions for setting cookies in the client.
                Custom headers: Can include additional information or metadata about the response.
                Body: The response body contains the actual data being sent from the server to the client. It can be in various formats, such as HTML, JSON, XML, or binary data.
            </pre>
            <p>
                These elements allow for flexible and extensible communication between clients and servers. The specific content of requests and responses depends on the purpose of the HTTP transaction, which can involve retrieving web pages, submitting form data, or interacting with web services.

                The World Wide Web
            </h2>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system that enables information sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and hobbyists.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tim Berners-Lee was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in that large and constantly changing organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                The design dismissed the common tree structure or needed keywords. Instead, it was inspired by Ted Nelson's hypertext models, that used hyperlinks to go to those hypertext.
            </p>
            <p>
                Berners-Lee model was supposed to support links between multiple databases on independent computers and allow access by many people at the same time. He also wanted it to handle more media than only text.
            </p>
            <p>
                He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other ways. Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or coordination over the creation of links.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system was implemented successfully in the year 1990, when it was named the WorldWideWeb and an HTTP server. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax, and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was released to other research institutions in 1991, and was finally made public in 1993, where it exploded in popularity. The NCSA released the Mosaic Web, which was able to display inline images. The Navigator Browser then introduced Java and JavaScript.  Netscape, the maker of the Navigator Browser, was made public and started the dot-com bubble.
            </p>
            <p>
                The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is built upon three core standards:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>HTTP as a protocol that allows browsers to request information from web servers.</li>
                <li>HTML as a markup language that structures information and defines document relationships through hyperlinks.</li>
                <li>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as a unique resource identifier used in hyperlinks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Additional standards introduced later include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the appearance and layout of web page elements, separating content from presentation.</li>
                <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), an evolution of HTTP that encrypts the entire data transfer through the TLS protocol.</li>
                <li>Document Object Model (DOM), which serves as a programming interface for external programs or scripting languages (like JavaScript) in web browsers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the WWW, along with others, develops the HTML and CSS standards. Other standards come from organizations like the Internet Engineering Task Force, ECMA, and companies such as Sun Microsystems. JavaScript, the most widely used scripting language in web browsers, is not standardized by the W3C.</p>
            <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to embed programs (scripts) in web browsers. This allows web pages to be dynamically modified using the Document Object Model (DOM). Scripts are typically small programs but can take complete control over the display as client managers with the help of the DOM. Microsoft's version of JavaScript is known as JScript, which is similar but not compatible. This incompatibility was a significant part of the "browser wars."</p>
            <p>The WWW has been supplemented with various technologies over time. Images were used early on for illustration, with GIFs for graphics and animations, and JPEG for photos. PNG later replaced GIF due to the absence of licensing fees.</p>
            <p>Browsers could display various file types through plug-ins, such as multimedia content, animations, music, videos, or entire applications like insurance calculators or navigation interfaces. For example, Java applets allowed embedding programs that ran locally on the user's computer, and Flash was used for interactive content and animations.</p>
            <p>With the introduction of HTML5 and standardized technologies, plug-ins were quickly replaced as browsers incorporated animation and multimedia features without external dependencies. Most major browsers now disable much or all of the NPAPI interface used by these plug-ins for security and stability reasons. However, formats like PDF for document viewing remain popular, often supported by built-in PDF readers in browsers.</p>
            <p>Dynamic web pages enable the World Wide Web (WWW) to serve as an interface for remotely executed programs. Programs are no longer conventionally launched locally on a computer but are viewed and operated through a web browser. The advantage here is that programs are no longer distributed on individual machines and don't need to be administrated locally (decentralized).</p>
            <p>Dynamic web applications are executed either on the web server or directly in the browser.</p>
            <p>Executing web applications on the web server: Content is generated by web applications written in scripting languages (like PHP or Perl) or compiled applications (such as JSP, Servlets, or ASP.NET) and delivered to the browser.</p>
            <p>Dynamic websites on the client: The browser generates or modifies content using JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Mixed execution: A mixed execution is represented by Ajax, where the browser sends a request using JavaScript, which is processed by the web server, dynamically updating parts of the HTML structure.</p>
            <p>One disadvantage is the limited expressive capabilities of WWW pages, making programs presented as web pages generally not as easy to operate as conventional programs. A trend aiming to reconcile both is Rich Internet Applications.</p>
            <p>Currently, more and more services that were originally separate from the WWW and operated as standalone programs are being offered via the WWW and can be used through a web browser. For instance, webmail often functions as an email client, and web FTP serves as an FTP client. Web forums replace Usenet, and web chats replace IRC.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="urls">
                URLs
            </h2>
            <p>
                A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism retrieving it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most commonly reference web pages but are also used for file transfer, emails, database access and many other things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI, which consists of five components decreasing significant left to right.
            </p>
            <p>
                A component is undefined if it has an associated delimiter and the delimiter does not appear in the URI; the scheme and path components are always defined. A component is empty if it has no characters; the scheme component is always non-empty. Authority components have subcomponents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The URI consists of the following: A non-empty scheme component, consisting of a sequence of characters beginning with a letter. Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. Examples of popular schemes include http, https, ftp, mailto, file, data and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.
            </p>
            <p>
                An optional authority component, which consists of an optional userinfo, a host subcomponent and an optional port. The userinfo may consist of a username and an optional password. Use of the format username:password in the userinfo subcomponent is deprecated for security reasons. Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon (:) found within an userinfo subcomponent unless the data after the colon is the empty string (indicating no password).
            </p>
            <p>
                The host subcomponent consists either of a registered name or an IP address. The port consists of decimal digits. There is also a path component, consisting of a sequence of path segments. A path is always defined, though it may be empty.  A path component may resemble or map exactly to a file system path but does not always imply a relation to one. If an authority component is defined, then the path component must either be empty or begin with a slash. By convention, in http and https URIs, the last part of a path is named path info and it is optional. It is composed by zero or more path segments that do not refer to an existing physical resource name (e.g. a file, an internal module program or an executable program) but to a logical part (e.g. a command or a qualifier part) that has to be passed separately to the first part of the path that identifies an executable module or program managed by a web server; this is often used to select dynamic content (a document, etc.) or to tailor it as requested (see also: CGI and PATH_INFO, etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                An optional query or fragment could also be: a query consists of query strings of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well-defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by a delimiter. A fragment contains a fragment identifier providing direction to a secondary resource, such as a section heading in an article identified by the remainder of the URI. When the primary resource is an HTML document, the fragment is often an id attribute of a specific element, and web browsers will scroll this element into view.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic URL structure consists of a schema designation that determines the access method, separated by a colon, and a scheme-specific part:
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;
            </p>
            <p>
                Schema (scheme): Specifies the technical method to address the resource. It is often, but not necessarily, identical to the network protocol used to locate the resource. Examples include:
            </p>
            <pre>
                With the same protocol: http, https, or ftp.
                With a different protocol: mailto (for sending emails) or file (for accessing local files).
                Scheme-Specific Part (scheme-specific part): Different schemes may require and allow different specific information. In most cases, it starts with the string //, but some variants define only a colon. The following examples are related to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
            </pre>
            <p>
                User and Password (user, password): If needed, login information, including a username and password, can be included. These are separated by a colon and prefixed with an "@" character.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that while HTTP is used in this example, specifying a username and password as part of the URL is not part of the HTTP specification. Current browsers accept this URL syntax but typically ask the user for confirmation to provide the entered data. Internet Explorer 6 (starting from Windows XP SP2) and newer versions differ by outright rejecting this URL syntax as erroneous. With a registry entry, their behavior can be changed to match that of predecessors up to version 5.5, which automatically and directly pass on the login data to the server. For some other protocols, such as FTP, providing user data in the shown format is entirely correct and covered by standards.

            <pre>
                Host: The host component is represented in the form of an IPv4 address separated by dots in decimal notation, an IPv6 address separated by colons in hexadecimal notation enclosed in square brackets, or an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

                Port: Port information allows the targeting of a specific TCP port. If no port is specified, the default port for the respective protocol is used, such as 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 21 for FTP.

                Path: The path describes a specific resource, which can align with the target system's directory structure, such as a file or directory on the server. The path can also be empty. An empty path can optionally be replaced by a slash and is equivalent to it.
                The interpretation (e.g., delivering a text file or executing a script) is up to the server. For example, when requesting the path / by a client, the server may deliver the content of a named file (like /index.html, /README, /HEADER) without revealing this to the requesting client. However, depending on the protocol, the server can also explicitly redirect to this resource or provide a directory listing.

                Query: In the case of HTTP, a query string can follow the actual resource pointer, separated by a question mark. This allows the transmission of additional information that can be further processed server- or client-side.

                Fragment: Following a double cross (#), a part of the resource can be referenced, typically an anchor in an HTML page to which the browser automatically scrolls after the page is loaded. For example, the URL http: //example.com/document.html#section3, in the fictitious document here, would prompt the browser to scroll to the beginning of the third section.

                n addition to the absolute or full URLs presented so far, there are also relative URLs. They are only valid within a context from which they inherit properties. Relative URLs lack the location specification on the World Wide Web or a real intranet. They are primarily possible within the group of http, https, and ftp, as well as with mailto. This is analogous to a phone number without an area code (of the country or the local area).

                Web Server
            </h2>
            <p>
                A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so.
            </p>
            <p>
                The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle. At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that run on racks of high-speed computers.
            </p>
            <p>
                A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server, or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.
            </p>
            <p>The primary role of a web server is to deliver static files (e.g., unchanging HTML or image files) or dynamically generated data, such as pages customized according to a logged-in user's profile.</p>
            <p>For a complete website, HTML pages along with linked style descriptions (CSS) and image files (JPG, PNG, GIF, SVG) are typically transmitted as individual files. Each required file prompts the web browser to send a separate request to the web server, which means that displaying a complex web page might require hundreds of requests and server responses. A web server is capable of simultaneously delivering the contents of a website to numerous different devices. The speed at which user requests are processed depends, in part, on the complexity of web content. For example, dynamic web content usually demands more resources than static content.</p>
            <p>Standardized transmission protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) and network protocols like IP and TCP, typically using Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS), are used for transmission. Currently, HTTP/2, derived from the experimental protocol SPDY, is in use.</p>
            <p>Most websites compile content from various sources when accessed.</p>
            <p>Scripting languages like ASP, PHP, or JSP interpret an HTML document server-side during a request and transmit it from the web server to the web browser. The previously separated content and structure from files and databases are processed into a document using a content management system. Websites and applications such as blogs, online forums, online stores, etc., employ this technique.</p>
            <p>Web servers can serve various functions beyond delivering static or dynamic documents:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> When authentication is not managed by the CMS, web servers can also utilize HTTP authentication.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS may be employed to encrypt server-client communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Cookie Management:</strong> Web servers can handle HTTP cookies.</li>
                <li><strong>Redirection:</strong> If no document is to be delivered, but the request should be redirected to another document, it can be achieved with a rewrite engine.</li>
                <li><strong>Errors:</strong> Any errors or successes are communicated to the browser through HTTP status codes and an error page.</li>
                <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Web servers typically log all requests in a log file, which can be used to generate statistics on page access counts. HTTP is a stateless protocol, and therefore, associating a request with a user through their IP address is generally possible, although it may not always be unique, especially in LAN web accesses. Intermediate proxy servers acting as clients to the web server further complicate this association.</li>
                <li><strong>Caching:</strong> With high access volumes, the resource-intensive dynamic content delivery can be buffered using HTTP caching, reducing the load on web servers, scripts, and databases.</li>
                <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Web servers are configured through specific configuration files or interfaces, either globally or through standardized formats like .htaccess.</li>
            </ul>

                Web Browser
            </h2>
            <p>
                A web browser is an application for accessing websites. When a user requests a web page from a particular website, the browser retrieves its files from a web server and then displays the page on the user's screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Browsers are used on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. In 2020, an estimated 4.9 billion people have used a browser. The most used browser is Google Chrome, with a 65% global market share on all devices, followed by Safari with 18%.
            </p>
            <p>
                A web browser is not the same thing as a search engine, though the two are often confused. A search engine is a website that provides links to other websites. However, to connect to a website's server and display its web pages, a user must have a web browser installed. In some technical contexts, browsers are referred to as user agents.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of a web browser is to fetch content from the World Wide Web or from local storage and display it on a user's device.
            </p>
            <p>
                This process begins when the user inputs a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) into the browser. Virtually all URLs are retrieved using the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), a set of rules for the transfer of data. If the URL uses the secure mode of HTTP (HTTPS), the connection between the browser and the web server is encrypted for the purposes of communications security and information privacy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Web pages usually contain hyperlinks to other pages and resources. Each link contains a URL, and when it is clicked or tapped, the browser navigates to the new resource. Most browsers use an internal cache of web page resources to improve loading times for subsequent visits to the same page. The cache can store many items, such as large images, so they do not need to be downloaded from the server again. Cached items are usually only stored for as long as the web server stipulates in its HTTP response messages.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the course of browsing, cookies received from various websites are stored by the browser. Some of them contain login credentials or site preferences. However, others are used for tracking user behavior over long periods of time, so browsers typically provide a section in the menu for deleting cookies. Finer-grained management of cookies usually requires a browser extension.

            </h3>
            <p>
                All HTML documents must start with a &lt;!DOCTYPE declaration&gt;. The declaration is not an HTML tag. It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
            </p>
            <h3 id="html_small">
                &lt;html&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;html&gt; tag represents the root of an HTML document. The &lt;html&gt; tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the !DOCTYPE tag).
            </p>
            <h3 id="head">
                &lt;head&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;head&gt; element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the &lt;html&gt; tag and the &lt;body&gt; tag. Metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.
            </p>
            <h3 id="meta">
                &lt;meta&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;meta&gt; tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data about data. &lt;meta&gt; tags go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable. Metadata is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), search engines (keywords), and other web services. There is a method to let web designers take control over the viewport (the user's visible area of a web page), through the meta tag (See "Setting The Viewport" example below).

            <h3 id="link">
                &lt;link&gt;

            <p>
                The &lt;link&gt; tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The &lt;link&gt; tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website. The &lt;link&gt; element is an empty element, it contains attributes only.
            </p>
            <h3 id="title">
                &lt;title&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;title&gt; tag defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab. The &lt;title&gt; tag is required in HTML documents. The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.
            </p>

            <p>
                The title element:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>defines a title in the browser toolbar</li>
                <li>provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites</li>
                <li>displays a title for the page in search-engine results</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Some characters are reserved in HTML. If you use the less than (&lt;) or greater than (&gt;) signs in your text, the browser might mix them with tags. Character entities are used to display reserved characters in HTML.
            </p>
            <h3 id="body">
                &lt;body&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;body&gt; tag defines the document's body. The body element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                The article tag specifies independent, self-contained content. An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently of the rest of the site. Potential sources for the &lt;article&gt; element:

                The HTML &lt;br&gt; element defines a line break.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use &lt;br&gt; if you want a line break (a new line) without starting a new paragraph:
            </p>
            <h3 id="pre">
                &lt;pre&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The element &lt;pre&gt; defines preformatted text. The text inside a &lt;pre&gt; element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves both spaces and line breaks:
            </p>
            <h3 id="div">
                &lt;div&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;div&gt; tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The &lt;div&gt; tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The &lt;div&gt; tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute.
            </p>
            <h3 id="span">
                &lt;span&gt;
            </h3>
            <p>
                The &lt;span&gt; tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document. The &lt;span> tag is easily styled by CSS or manipulated with JavaScript using the class or id attribute. The &lt;span> tag is much like the &lt;div> element, but &lt;div> is a block-level element and &lt;span> is an inline element.
            </p>

                The &lt;a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The most important attribute of the &lt;a> element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
                <li>A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
                <li>An active link is underlined and red</li>
            </ul>

                HTML documents start with the doctype declaration. The document starts with &lt;html&gt; and ends with &lt;/html&gt;. The visible part of HTML is in the body declaration.
            </p>
            <p>
                DOCTYPE represents document type and helps the browser display web pages. It's not case-sensitive and must appear only once at the top.
            </p>
            <p>
                Headings are defined by the &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt; tags. They decrease in significance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Paragraphs are defined with &lt;p&gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML links are defined with the &lt;a&gt; tag: the destination is defined by "href". Attributes are there to provide additional information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag. It contains the source (src), alternative text (alt) (needed when image cannot be loaded), and the width and height.
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML can be viewed by inspecting a website.

            <p>
                An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag. Elements can be nested, but the end tag is often needed, otherwise it may display incorrectly. They can be empty, and aren't case-sensitive ( &lt;p&gt; == &lt;P&gt;).
            </p>
            <p>
                HTML elements with no content are called empty elements. For example: the &lt;br&gt; tag defines a line break, and is an empty element without a closing tag:

            <p>
                All elements can have attributes. They provide additional information about elements, are specified in the start tag and usually come in name/value pairs (name=""). Examples of attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>href in &lt;a&gt;: URL of the page the link goes to</li>

                <li>width and height in &lt;img&gt;: provide info about size</li>
                <li>alt in &lt;img&gt;: displays text when image cant be loaded</li>
                <li>style: colors, font, size and more</li>
                <li>lang in &lt;html&gt;: declares the language of the page</li>

            </h3>
            <p>
                HTML links are hyperlinks. Clicking on a link jumps to another document. The HTML &lt;a&gt; defines a hyperlink. The most important part of the element is the href attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link. This can be done by using &lt;target&gt;.
            </p>
            <p>
                Attributes of &lt;target&gt;;
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>_self: Opens document on the same page it was clicked</li>
                <li>_blank: Opens document in a new window/tab</li>
                <li>_parent: Opens document in parent frame</li>
                <li>_top: Opens document in the full body of the window</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Both examples above are using an absolute URL (a full web address) in the href attribute. A local link (a link to a page within the same website) is specified with a relative URL (without the "https://www" part).
            </p>
            <p>
                To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.

            </h3>
            <p>
                Images can help the visuals of a web page. It has the following syntax:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>&lt;img&gt;: embed an image. Not inserted, just links. The tag creates the holding space. It has 2 needed attributes (src, alt).</li>
                <li>src: when a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, the image should actually stay in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise the image will not load. This is when the alt text is shown.</li>
                <li>alt: provides an alternate text when an image can't be loaded. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are also unneeded (but useful) attributes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>width and height: set the size of the image when it is displayed.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                When an image is in another folder it is needed to be specified in the src.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some websites point to an image on another server. To point to an image on another server, you must specify an absolute (full) URL in the src attribute:
            </p>
            <p>
                By putting the &lt;img&gt; tag in an &lt;a&gt; tag you can use an link as the image.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also use float.

            <p>
                The &lt;head&gt; contains metadata (information about information) and usually describes document title, character set, styles, scripts and other meta info.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;title&gt; is text-only and is shown in the title-bar. It's required in HTML, and it is important for search engines.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;style&gt; is for style info.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;link&gt; defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. Most used to link to external style sheets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The &lt;meta&gt; element is typically used to specify the character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. The metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is used by browsers (how to display content or reload page), by search engines (keywords), and other web services.
            </p>
            <p>
                The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page. It varies with the device - it will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.
            </p>
            <p>
                &lt;script&gt; is used for client-side JavaScripts.

            <p>
                The element selectors select based on name.
            </p>
            <p>
                The id selectors select based on id attribute. IDs are unique so it is used to select an unique element.

            <p>
                The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
