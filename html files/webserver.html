        Web Server
    </h2>
    <p>
        A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP or its secure
        variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by making a
        request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that
        resource or an error message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if
        configured to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
        The hardware used to run a web server can vary according to the volume of requests that it needs to handle.
        At the low end of the range are embedded systems, such as a router that runs a small web server as its
        configuration interface. A high-traffic Internet website might handle requests with hundreds of servers that
        run on racks of high-speed computers.
    </p>
    <p>
        A resource sent from a web server can be a pre-existing file (static content) available to the web server,
        or it can be generated at the time of the request (dynamic content) by another program that communicates
        with the server software. The former usually can be served faster and can be more easily cached for repeated
        requests, while the latter supports a broader range of applications.
    </p>
    <p>
        Technologies such as REST and SOAP, which use HTTP as a basis for general computer-to-computer
        communication, as well as support for WebDAV extensions, have extended the application of web servers well
        beyond their original purpose of serving human-readable pages.
    </p>
    <p>The primary role of a web server is to deliver static files (e.g., unchanging HTML or image files) or
        dynamically generated data, such as pages customized according to a logged-in user's profile.</p>
    <p>For a complete website, HTML pages along with linked style descriptions (CSS) and image files (JPG, PNG, GIF,
        SVG) are typically transmitted as individual files. Each required file prompts the web browser to send a
        separate request to the web server, which means that displaying a complex web page might require hundreds of
        requests and server responses. A web server is capable of simultaneously delivering the contents of a
        website to numerous different devices. The speed at which user requests are processed depends, in part, on
        the complexity of web content. For example, dynamic web content usually demands more resources than static
        content.</p>
    <p>Standardized transmission protocols (HTTP, HTTPS) and network protocols like IP and TCP, typically using Port
        80 (HTTP) and Port 443 (HTTPS), are used for transmission. Currently, HTTP/2, derived from the experimental
        protocol SPDY, is in use.</p>
    <p>Most websites compile content from various sources when accessed.</p>
    <p>Scripting languages like ASP, PHP, or JSP interpret an HTML document server-side during a request and
        transmit it from the web server to the web browser. The previously separated content and structure from
        files and databases are processed into a document using a content management system. Websites and
        applications such as blogs, online forums, online stores, etc., employ this technique.</p>
    <p>Web servers can serve various functions beyond delivering static or dynamic documents:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> When authentication is not managed by the CMS, web servers can also
            utilize HTTP authentication.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Security:</strong> HTTPS may be employed to encrypt server-client communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Cookie Management:</strong> Web servers can handle HTTP cookies.</li>
        <li><strong>Redirection:</strong> If no document is to be delivered, but the request should be redirected to
            another document, it can be achieved with a rewrite engine.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Errors:</strong> Any errors or successes are communicated to the browser through HTTP status
            codes and an error page.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Web servers typically log all requests in a log file, which can be used to
            generate statistics on page access counts. HTTP is a stateless protocol, and therefore, associating a
            request with a user through their IP address is generally possible, although it may not always be
            unique, especially in LAN web accesses. Intermediate proxy servers acting as clients to the web server
            further complicate this association.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Caching:</strong> With high access volumes, the resource-intensive dynamic content delivery can
            be buffered using HTTP caching, reducing the load on web servers, scripts, and databases.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Configuration:</strong> Web servers are configured through specific configuration files or
            interfaces, either globally or through standardized formats like .htaccess.
        </li>
    </ul>
