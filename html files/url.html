        URLs
    </h2>
    <p>
        A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a reference to a resource that specifies its location on a computer
        network and a mechanism retrieving it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most commonly reference web pages but are also used for file transfer, emails, database access and many
        other things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most web browsers display the URL of a web page above the page in an address bar.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of a generic URI, which consists of five components decreasing
        significant left to right.
    </p>
    <p>
        A component is undefined if it has an associated delimiter and the delimiter does not appear in the URI; the
        scheme and path components are always defined. A component is empty if it has no characters; the scheme
        component is always non-empty. Authority components have subcomponents.
    </p>
    <p>
        The URI consists of the following: A non-empty scheme component, consisting of a sequence of characters
        beginning with a letter. Although schemes are case-insensitive, the canonical form is lowercase and
        documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. Examples of popular schemes include http,
        https, ftp, mailto, file, data and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers
        Authority (IANA), although non-registered schemes are used in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
        An optional authority component, which consists of an optional userinfo, a host subcomponent and an optional
        port. The userinfo may consist of a username and an optional password. Use of the format username:password
        in the userinfo subcomponent is deprecated for security reasons. Applications should not render as clear
        text any data after the first colon (:) found within an userinfo subcomponent unless the data after the
        colon is the empty string (indicating no password).
    </p>
    <p>
        The host subcomponent consists either of a registered name or an IP address. The port consists of decimal
        digits. There is also a path component, consisting of a sequence of path segments. A path is always defined,
        though it may be empty. A path component may resemble or map exactly to a file system path but does not
        always imply a relation to one. If an authority component is defined, then the path component must either be
        empty or begin with a slash. By convention, in http and https URIs, the last part of a path is named path
        info and it is optional. It is composed by zero or more path segments that do not refer to an existing
        physical resource name (e.g. a file, an internal module program or an executable program) but to a logical
        part (e.g. a command or a qualifier part) that has to be passed separately to the first part of the path
        that identifies an executable module or program managed by a web server; this is often used to select
        dynamic content (a document, etc.) or to tailor it as requested (see also: CGI and PATH_INFO, etc.).
    </p>
    <p>
        An optional query or fragment could also be: a query consists of query strings of non-hierarchical data. Its
        syntax is not well-defined, but by convention is most often a sequence of attributeâ€“value pairs separated by
        a delimiter. A fragment contains a fragment identifier providing direction to a secondary resource, such as
        a section heading in an article identified by the remainder of the URI. When the primary resource is an HTML
        document, the fragment is often an id attribute of a specific element, and web browsers will scroll this
        element into view.
    </p>
    <p>
        The basic URL structure consists of a schema designation that determines the access method, separated by a
        colon, and a scheme-specific part:
    </p>
    <p>
        &lt;scheme&gt;:&lt;scheme-specific-part&gt;
    </p>
    <p>
        Schema (scheme): Specifies the technical method to address the resource. It is often, but not necessarily,
        identical to the network protocol used to locate the resource. Examples include:
    </p>
    <pre>
                With the same protocol: http, https, or ftp.
                With a different protocol: mailto (for sending emails) or file (for accessing local files).
                Scheme-Specific Part (scheme-specific part): Different schemes may require and allow different specific information. In most cases, it starts with the string //, but some variants define only a colon. The following examples are related to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).
            </pre>
    <p>
        User and Password (user, password): If needed, login information, including a username and password, can be
        included. These are separated by a colon and prefixed with an "@" character.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that while HTTP is used in this example, specifying a username and password as part of the URL
        is not part of the HTTP specification. Current browsers accept this URL syntax but typically ask the user
        for confirmation to provide the entered data. Internet Explorer 6 (starting from Windows XP SP2) and newer
        versions differ by outright rejecting this URL syntax as erroneous. With a registry entry, their behavior
        can be changed to match that of predecessors up to version 5.5, which automatically and directly pass on the
        login data to the server. For some other protocols, such as FTP, providing user data in the shown format is
        entirely correct and covered by standards.
    </p>
    <pre>
                Host: The host component is represented in the form of an IPv4 address separated by dots in decimal notation, an IPv6 address separated by colons in hexadecimal notation enclosed in square brackets, or an FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name).

                Port: Port information allows the targeting of a specific TCP port. If no port is specified, the default port for the respective protocol is used, such as 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 21 for FTP.

                Path: The path describes a specific resource, which can align with the target system's directory structure, such as a file or directory on the server. The path can also be empty. An empty path can optionally be replaced by a slash and is equivalent to it.
                The interpretation (e.g., delivering a text file or executing a script) is up to the server. For example, when requesting the path / by a client, the server may deliver the content of a named file (like /index.html, /README, /HEADER) without revealing this to the requesting client. However, depending on the protocol, the server can also explicitly redirect to this resource or provide a directory listing.

                Query: In the case of HTTP, a query string can follow the actual resource pointer, separated by a question mark. This allows the transmission of additional information that can be further processed server- or client-side.

                Fragment: Following a double cross (#), a part of the resource can be referenced, typically an anchor in an HTML page to which the browser automatically scrolls after the page is loaded. For example, the URL http: //example.com/document.html#section3, in the fictitious document here, would prompt the browser to scroll to the beginning of the third section.

    <p>
        n addition to the absolute or full URLs presented so far, there are also relative URLs. They are only valid
        within a context from which they inherit properties. Relative URLs lack the location specification on the
        World Wide Web or a real intranet. They are primarily possible within the group of http, https, and ftp, as
        well as with mailto. This is analogous to a phone number without an area code (of the country or the local
        area).
