        HTTP
    </h2>
    <p>
        HTTP is a protocol of the application layer, specifically on the 7th layer in the ISO/OSI model. It is
        stateless, but session data can be stored using cookies. HTTP is not limited to exchanging hypertext but can
        also transfer various data types. It relies on a reliable transport protocol, typically TCP (until HTTP/2)
        or QUIC (HTTP/3, based on UDP). Common versions include HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1, with newer web browsers
        supporting HTTP/2.
    </p>
    <p>
        HTTP communication involves two types of messages: requests from the client to the server and responses from
        the server to the client. Each message consists of two parts, the message header (HTTP header) containing
        information about the message body, such as encoding and content type, and the message body containing the
        actual data.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a web browser activates a link to the URL http: //www.example.net/infotext.html, it sends a request to
        the computer with the hostname www.example.net to retrieve the resource /infotext.html. The hostname
        www.example.net is first translated into an IP address using the DNS protocol. The HTTP-GET request is sent
        over TCP to the HTTP server's standard port 80.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the link contains characters not allowed in the request, they are URL-encoded. Additional information,
        such as browser details and desired language, can be transmitted through the header in any HTTP
        communication. The "Host" field distinguishes different DNS names under the same IP address. It is optional
        under HTTP/1.0 but required under HTTP/1.1. Once the header is terminated with a blank line (or two
        consecutive line endings), the computer running a web server on port 80 sends an HTTP response. This
        response includes server header information, a blank line, and the actual content of the message, which is
        the content of the infotext.html file. Files are typically transmitted in page description languages like
        (X)HTML along with their components like images, stylesheets (CSS), scripts (JavaScript), etc., often
        combined by a browser for display. In principle, any file in any format can be transmitted, including
        dynamically generated content (e.g., CGI, SSI, JSP, PHP, or ASP.NET). Each header line is terminated by a
        line break &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;. The blank line after the header consists only of &gt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;,
        without any enclosed spaces.
    </p>
    <pre>
        Response:

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Server: Apache/1.3.29 (Unix) PHP/4.3.4
        Content-Length: 123456 (Size of infotext.html in bytes)
        Content-Language: de (per RFC 3282 and RFC 1766)
        Connection: close
        Content-Type: text/html
    </pre>
    <p>
        The server sends an error message and an error code if the information cannot be sent for any reason.
        However, status codes are also used for successful requests, typically with a response of 200 OK. The exact
        process of this exchange (request and response) is defined in the HTTP specification.
    </p>
    <p>
        Every HTTP request receives a response from the server with an HTTP status code. This code provides
        information on whether the request was successfully processed, or in case of an error, it guides the client,
        such as a browser, on where (e.g., redirection) or how (e.g., with authentication) to obtain the desired
        information if possible.
    </p>
    <pre>
        1xx – Informational
        The request is still being processed, despite the initial response. This intermediate response can be necessary because many clients automatically assume a transmission or processing error after a certain period (timeout) and abort with an error message.
        2xx – Successful Operation
        The request has been processed, and the response is sent back to the requester.
        3xx – Redirection
        To ensure successful processing of the request, further actions are required by the client. This occurs, for example, when a website has been redesigned by the operator, causing a requested file to be located elsewhere. The server response, including a Location header, informs the client of the new file location.
        4xx – Client Errors
        An error occurred in processing the request, and it is within the client's responsibility. For example, a 404 error occurs when a document is requested that does not exist on the server. A 403 error informs the client that it is not permitted to access the respective document, which could be confidential or only accessible via HTTPS.
        5xx – Server Errors
        An error has occurred, and the cause of the error is attributed to the server. For instance, a 501 error indicates that the server lacks the necessary functions (e.g., programs or other files) to process the request.
    </pre>
    <p>Requests and Responses:</p>
    <pre>
        HTTP Requests:

        Request Method: Specifies the action to be performed, such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
        Request URL: The URL or URI that the client is requesting.
        Headers: These contain additional information about the request, including:
        User-Agent: Information about the client application making the request.
        Accept: The data formats (MIME types) that the client can accept. (language)
        Authorization: Credentials for authentication.
        Cookies: Data sent to the server for maintaining session state.
        Custom headers: Can include any additional information needed for the request.
        Body: For methods like POST and PUT, the body can contain data to be sent to the server. It can be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or form data.
        Status Code.

        HTTP Responses:

        Status Line: Includes the HTTP version, status code, and a brief status message.
        Headers: Similar to request headers, response headers contain additional information about the response, including:
        Server: Information about the server software.
        Content-Type: The MIME type of the response data.
        Content-Length: The size of the response body in bytes.
        Set-Cookie: Instructions for setting cookies in the client.
        Custom headers: Can include additional information or metadata about the response.
        Body: The response body contains the actual data being sent from the server to the client. It can be in various formats, such as HTML, JSON, XML, or binary data.
    </pre>
    <p>
        These elements allow for flexible and extensible communication between clients and servers. The specific
        content of requests and responses depends on the purpose of the HTTP transaction, which can involve
        retrieving web pages, submitting form data, or interacting with web services.
