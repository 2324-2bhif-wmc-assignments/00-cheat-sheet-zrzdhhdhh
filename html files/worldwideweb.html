        The World Wide Web
    </h2>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system that enables information
        sharing over the Internet through user-friendly ways meant to appeal to users beyond IT specialists and
        hobbyists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tim Berners-Lee was motivated by the problem of storing, updating, and finding documents and data files in
        that large and constantly changing organization.
    </p>
    <p>
        The design dismissed the common tree structure or needed keywords. Instead, it was inspired by Ted Nelson's
        hypertext models, that used hyperlinks to go to those hypertext.
    </p>
    <p>
        Berners-Lee model was supposed to support links between multiple databases on independent computers and
        allow access by many people at the same time. He also wanted it to handle more media than only text.
    </p>
    <p>
        He also conceived "gateways" that would allow access through the new system to documents organized in other
        ways. Finally, he insisted that the system should be decentralized, without any central control or
        coordination over the creation of links.
    </p>
    <p>
        The system was implemented successfully in the year 1990, when it was named the WorldWideWeb and an HTTP
        server. As part of that development he defined the first version of the HTTP protocol, the basic URL syntax,
        and implicitly made HTML the primary document format.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was released to other research institutions in 1991, and was finally made public in 1993, where it
        exploded in popularity. The NCSA released the Mosaic Web, which was able to display inline images. The
        Navigator Browser then introduced Java and JavaScript. Netscape, the maker of the Navigator Browser, was
        made public and started the dot-com bubble.
    </p>
    <p>
        The World Wide Web has been central to the development of the Information Age and is the primary tool
        billions of people use to interact on the Internet.
    </p>
    <p>The World Wide Web (WWW) is built upon three core standards:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>HTTP as a protocol that allows browsers to request information from web servers.</li>
        <li>HTML as a markup language that structures information and defines document relationships through
            hyperlinks.
        </li>
        <li>Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) as a unique resource identifier used in hyperlinks.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional standards introduced later include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the appearance and layout of web page elements, separating
            content from presentation.
        </li>
        <li>Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), an evolution of HTTP that encrypts the entire data transfer
            through the TLS protocol.
        </li>
        <li>Document Object Model (DOM), which serves as a programming interface for external programs or scripting
            languages (like JavaScript) in web browsers.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), currently led by Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the WWW, along with
        others, develops the HTML and CSS standards. Other standards come from organizations like the Internet
        Engineering Task Force, ECMA, and companies such as Sun Microsystems. JavaScript, the most widely used
        scripting language in web browsers, is not standardized by the W3C.</p>
    <p>JavaScript is a scripting language used to embed programs (scripts) in web browsers. This allows web pages to
        be dynamically modified using the Document Object Model (DOM). Scripts are typically small programs but can
        take complete control over the display as client managers with the help of the DOM. Microsoft's version of
        JavaScript is known as JScript, which is similar but not compatible. This incompatibility was a significant
        part of the "browser wars."</p>
    <p>The WWW has been supplemented with various technologies over time. Images were used early on for
        illustration, with GIFs for graphics and animations, and JPEG for photos. PNG later replaced GIF due to the
        absence of licensing fees.</p>
    <p>Browsers could display various file types through plug-ins, such as multimedia content, animations, music,
        videos, or entire applications like insurance calculators or navigation interfaces. For example, Java
        applets allowed embedding programs that ran locally on the user's computer, and Flash was used for
        interactive content and animations.</p>
    <p>With the introduction of HTML5 and standardized technologies, plug-ins were quickly replaced as browsers
        incorporated animation and multimedia features without external dependencies. Most major browsers now
        disable much or all of the NPAPI interface used by these plug-ins for security and stability reasons.
        However, formats like PDF for document viewing remain popular, often supported by built-in PDF readers in
        browsers.</p>
    <p>Dynamic web pages enable the World Wide Web (WWW) to serve as an interface for remotely executed programs.
        Programs are no longer conventionally launched locally on a computer but are viewed and operated through a
        web browser. The advantage here is that programs are no longer distributed on individual machines and don't
        need to be administrated locally (decentralized).</p>
    <p>Dynamic web applications are executed either on the web server or directly in the browser.</p>
    <p>Executing web applications on the web server: Content is generated by web applications written in scripting
        languages (like PHP or Perl) or compiled applications (such as JSP, Servlets, or ASP.NET) and delivered to
        the browser.</p>
    <p>Dynamic websites on the client: The browser generates or modifies content using JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Mixed execution: A mixed execution is represented by Ajax, where the browser sends a request using
        JavaScript, which is processed by the web server, dynamically updating parts of the HTML structure.</p>
    <p>One disadvantage is the limited expressive capabilities of WWW pages, making programs presented as web pages
        generally not as easy to operate as conventional programs. A trend aiming to reconcile both is Rich Internet
        Applications.</p>
    <p>Currently, more and more services that were originally separate from the WWW and operated as standalone
        programs are being offered via the WWW and can be used through a web browser. For instance, webmail often
        functions as an email client, and web FTP serves as an FTP client. Web forums replace Usenet, and web chats
        replace IRC.</p>
